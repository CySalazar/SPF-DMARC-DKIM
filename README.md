# SPF-DMARC-DKIM

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)

A .NET Core application to check email security configurations (SPF, DMARC, and DKIM) of a domain, with a particular focus on DKIM for which it can automatically detect the selector.

## üîç Project Philosophy

SPF-DMARC-DKIM was born from the need to have a practical and versatile tool to quickly verify the configuration of email security protocols for a domain. The uniqueness of this project, compared to other available solutions, is the ability to automatically detect DKIM selectors through a "brute-force" approach using a list of the most common selectors.

The mission of the project is to simplify the process of verifying and diagnosing DNS configurations related to email security, offering a tool that is:

- **Fast**: Provides immediate results with response time indication
- **Complete**: Checks all three main email security protocols (SPF, DMARC, DKIM)
- **Autonomous**: Does not require prior knowledge of the DKIM selector
- **Informative**: Also displays other relevant DNS records (TXT, MX, A/AAAA)
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üõ†Ô∏è Structure and Implementation

The project is implemented in C# using .NET Core, making it cross-platform. The structure is organized in specialized classes:

- **DNSSec**: Base class that provides common functionality for domain formatting and DNS management
- **SPF**: Implements verification of SPF records
- **DMARC**: Implements verification of DMARC records
- **DKIM**: Implements verification of DKIM records with automatic selector detection

Each class provides information on detection time, useful for evaluating DNS configuration performance.

The application uses the `DnsClient` library to perform DNS queries and implements a spinner system (graphical display) during queries to improve user experience.

### Main technical features:

- Automatic handling of various domain input formats (full URLs, IPs, simple domains)
- Support for multi-level TLDs (.co.uk, .com.br, etc.)
- Robust error handling
- Automatic detection of DKIM selectors from a predefined list
- Response time measurement for each verification

## üìö How to Use the Software

### Prerequisites

- .NET Core 6.0 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/SPF-DMARC-DKIM.git
   cd SPF-DMARC-DKIM
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   dotnet build
   ```

### Command-line Usage

Run the application specifying the domain as an argument:

```
dotnet run example.com
```

Or run without arguments and enter the domain when prompted:

```
dotnet run
Domain: example.com
```

### Output

The application will show:
- The status of SPF, DMARC, and DKIM records (found or not found)
- The content of the records, if present
- The time taken to detect each record
- For DKIM, also the selector found and the time taken to find it
- All TXT, MX, and A/AAAA records associated with the domain

### Integration into your code

The SPF, DMARC, and DKIM classes can also be used independently within another project:

```csharp
// Example of using the SPF class
SPF spf = new SPF();
spf.Domain = "example.com";

if (spf.Found)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"SPF found in {spf.TimeToDetectSPF}ms");
    Console.WriteLine(spf.Record);
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("SPF not found");
}

// Similarly for DMARC and DKIM
```
